# JukeBox
A music player made using Tkinter Framework in python.

The music player supports .mp3 and .wav file formats. Users can add and delete songs to their playlist.\n The total length of each song as well as the current playing time is also shown.
There is a status bar at the bottom, which tells the user about the current status at any point of time : whether music is being played or paused or muted.

Widgets like Buttons, Listbox, MenuBar, StatusBar have been used to make the GUI more attractive and user-friendly. The music player also throws error when no song(s) are selected to play.
