# JukeBox
A music player made using Tkinter Framework in python.

The music player supports .mp3 and .wav file formats.\n 
The window has been divided into two main frames: the left and right frame.
The left frame contains the Listbox widget where user can add
and delete songs to their playlist. Below the listbox are two buttons: "+Add" and "-Del" for adding and deleting songs respectively.
The right frame is again divided into three frames: the top, middle and bottom frames.

The top frame contains the labels of Total Length and Current Time. The total length of each song as well as the current playing time is also shown. 
The middle frame contains the Start, Pause and Stop buttons.
The bottom frame contains the Rewind, Mute and Volume Scale.

At the extreme end of the window, there is a StatusBar which shows the current status of the music player. It also displays the name of the song that is currently being played.

The icon and the buttons have been downloaded from the website: www.flaticon.com
Messageboxes have been used to generate messages and errors to the user.
 
Lastly, themes has been used to make the music player more attractive and better-looking.
I faced problems while trying to convert the project into an executable using cx_Freeze. You are welcome to convert it into an executable and GIT it with me. Just make a PR and I will merge it.
